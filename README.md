# leela-connect4-ai
This project is an implementation of an AlphaZero-style AI for Connect Four. It combines deep reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to learn how to play the game entirely through self-play. Built with PyTorch, it lets you train the model, evaluate its performance, and even play against the AI from the command line.
